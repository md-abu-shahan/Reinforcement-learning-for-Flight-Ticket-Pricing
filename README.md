# Reinforcement-learning-for-Flight-Ticket-Pricing
From the beginning of the 20th century Airplane is the world's most expensive transportation system. The price of the air tickets often fluctuate before the departure date. This paper reports a study on the behavior of the air ticket of a particular period of time to predict the optimal time to buy the tickets. We prepared a method to mining the air fare data using Q-Learning algorithm. We also prepared another method using Deep Q-Network. Both of models can predict the optimal time to buy the air tickets. Before implementing our models we studied a lot of things about Reinforcement Learning, Markov Decision Process (MDP), Q-Learning and Deep Q-Network.
